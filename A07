180. Many words, like ski and race, can be used as nouns or verbs with no difference in pronunciation. Can you think of others? 
Hint: think of a commonplace object and try to put the word to before it to see if it can also be a verb, or think of an action and try to put 
the before it to see if it can also be a noun. Now make up a sentence with both uses of this word, and run the POS tagger on this sentence.

We used the steel hammer to hammer in the nail.

184. Plot the frequency distribution just shown using tag_fd.plot(cumulative=True). What percentage of words are tagged using the first five tags of the above list?

186. Given the list of past participles specified by cfd2['VN'].keys(), try to collect a list of all the word-tag pairs that immediately precede items in that list.

188. Open the POS concordance tool nltk.app.concordance() and load the complete Brown Corpus (simplified tagset). Now pick some of the words
listed at the end of the previous code example and see how the tag of the word correlates with the context of the word. E.g., search for near
to see all forms mixed together, near/ADJ to see it used as an adjective, near N to see just those cases where a noun follows, and so forth.
