1. The IOB format categorizes tagged tokens as I, O and B. Why are three tags necessary? What problem would be caused if we used I and O tags exclusively?

IOB stands for inside, outside, and begin.
IOB tags are often the standard format for chunks in files. These tags are similar to part-of-speech tags but can denote the inside, outside, and beginning of a chunk. Not just noun phrase but multiple different chunk phrase types are allowed here.
B-NP: beginning of a noun phrase
I-NP: describes that the word is inside of the current noun phrase.
O: end of the sentence.
B-VP and I-VP: beginning and inside of a verb phrase.
It is used for tagging tokens in a chunking task such as named-entity recognition.
These tags are similar to part-of-speech tags but give us information about the location of the word in the chunk.
It assigns a tag to each word in the text, determining whether it is the beginning (B) of a known named entity, inside (I) it, or outside (O) of any known named entities.
Three tags are necessary because a boundary tag will prevent the two other tags from overlapping.

If I and O tags were utilized exclusively, the lack of a beginning for the chunk would result in overlapping tokens. 
Chunkers are supposed to create relatively flat data structures so overlap is not allowed.
The lack of a boundary between a chunk structure's inside and outside will render the difference between the beginning of an entity & it's nearby continuation undetectable.
